Arduino Keyboard Hacks
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/algernon/arduino-kbd-tap-dance.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/algernon/arduino-kbd-tap-dance)

Primarily aimed at the [Keyboard.io Model 01][kbdio], but likely usable by any
other keyboard built with an Arduino at heart. Let me first say that this has
not been tested on any real hardware, and as such, is more a proof of concept,
than anything else.
